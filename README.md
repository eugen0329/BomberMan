Description
===========
My old university course project. The protagonist, space bomber who is fleeing
monsters-slugs, throwing bombs to destroy them. Its main goal is to stay alive
as longer as possible and to score as much as possible points.

Install:
========

cmake .
make

Usage:
====

In console:
    ./bin

Menu points are selecting using mouse. To control the character use w, a, s, d buttons.
To plant the bomb press space button. You have only five hits and the goal
is to score the most points. I hope you enjoyed!:)
